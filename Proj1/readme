KNOWN ISSUES
 - Very long name given with -n and -f may cause buffer overflow and segfault.
 - If too much data is transfered client system may run out of memory.
 - Some variables may be uninitialized (valgrind will show error).
 - Very rarely a child process will not end.
 - Slow connection and a lot of data may cause client to stop reading before all data are received.
 - Large amount of data will take a long time to transfer and may be incomplete.
 - Sometimes server will stop responding to requests.  

USAGE
 SERVER
 ./ipk-server -p [port number]

 - Server will run until killed with ^C.
 - NOTICE: Server waits for 1 second after sending data size to client, before data is sent.
   This is to allow client to prepare it's buffer and so that messages don't get merged by TCP

 CLIENT
 ./ipk-client -h [host] -p[port] [-n|-f|-l] [login]

 - If request is valid and server finds requested data, this data will be received.
 - If request is invalid (client failed to authorize, no data found, invalid search parameters)
   no data will be returned and connection closed by the server.
